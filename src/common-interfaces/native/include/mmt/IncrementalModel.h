         * Add a new aligned sentence pair to this model.
         *
         * The invocation of this method is always made by exactly one thread at time, so
         * the implementation of this method does not need to handle exclusive access to resources
         * or, more in general, worry about multi-thread execution.
         *
         * It is not required to be immediately persistent: the sentence pairs can be added to
         * a batch that, at some point in the future, will be flushed into the model. However it is
         * highly recommended that:
         *      - The execution of this method never take more than 1 second.
         *      - A pending update does not wait more than 2 seconds before being written to the model.
         *
         * An update always comes with an identifier consisting in a stream-id, the source identifier, and
         * a sequential id that identifies the sentence pair within the sequence. Within a particular stream,
         * a newer update has always a higher sequential id of an older one. However it is possible to receive
         * and update with an id that is lower than the current newest value for a particular stream; in
         * this case the model must recognize this situation and discard the update.
         *
         * On the contrary, there are no guarantees for sequential ids with different stream-id:
         * a sequential id is valid only within its stream.
         * Thus an IncrementalModel must keep track of the higher id value for each stream.
         *
         * It is mandatory that the latest sequential id is stored atomically with the latest flush.
         * If the actual implementation writes the data and updates the latest id in two separate steps,
         * there is the chance to leave the model in a inconsistent state and to receive the same
         * update twice.
         *
         * @param id the update unique id.
         * @param source the source sentence.
         * @param target the target sentence.
         * @param alignment the sentence pair alignment.
